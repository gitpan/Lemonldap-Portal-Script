    Lemonldap::Portal::Script - Perl extension for Lemonldap websso
    framework

SYNOPSIS
      use Lemonldap::Portal::Script
      $exchange = Lemonldap::Portal::Script::Exchange->new( numero => $cp, requete => $line );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implementes 3 objects class : Exchange, Question ,Response

    An Exchange is composed of one question and one response.

    The parsing_example.pl shows how it works.

    First use firefox plugin in order to have client-server dialog in plain
    text file. I use The LiveHTTPHeaders for Firefox in order to recording
    connection on web site.
    Second ,the text dialog file is parsed by te program. It may split
    exchange in two groups. One for true exchange (authentication form)
    second for useless exchange : jpeg, css .

        filtered dialog
        apache virtual configuration file
        perl script or handler processing connection on web server

  Methods
         $line means a line of dialog file recording.

        Exchange->new( numero => $cp, requete => $line );
        Exchange->set_tirade('response',$response);
        Exchange->set_tirade('question',$question);
        Exchange->add_string("--------Fin echange $echange->{numero}");
        Exchange->set_method($line);# GET /POST
        Exchange->set_ResponseCode($line);# 200, 302 ..
        Exchange->as_string;
        Exchange->set_status (required , y/n )
